# Roadmap

Updates will be announced on [our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/zwin_project)!

## Release coming soon 

In order to improve the convenience of Zwin, we are planning to release the following critical features very soon.

#### XWayland support

XWayland runs on top of Wayland compositors and forward the windows from X11 applications to the compositors in a Wayland-compatible way. XWayland support will be released on Zen soon, and it enables the users to run X11 applications not compatible with Wayland such as Visual Studio Code on Zen.

#### Popup / Subsurface
Some wayland applications create another window on the main window. Right-click menu of Google Chrome is a good example. These are called Popup / Subsurface in Wayland, and Zen will support these features soon.
âœ… *2022/01/23 - Popup has been implemented!*

#### Copy & Paste / Drag & Drop in 2D windows
Some well-known features of 2D operations on 2D windows such as Copy & Paste / Drag & Drop are not supported by Zen. We plan to support them soon to let users use 2D apps in Zwin as in the existing 2D windowing systems.

## Second release
With the goal of replacing everyday desktop environment, we are planning to release the following contents as the second large release. As of the first release (Jan 16, 2023), the target date of the second release is Jan 16, 2024.

### Core concepts


#### Space
[Space](/en/what_is_it/interactions_on_zen#space-(under-development)) is a concept for swapping multiple environments easily.

Space will be implemented and included in the second release.

#### Arragement of apps on the world coordinate
In the current implementation, the positions of the windows in the VR world are limited to the surface of Seat Capsule, which is the combintaion of a cylinder & spheres surrouding the user.  
In the second release, we are planning to remove this restriction to put the applications anywhere in the world coordinate.

#### Ray lock
When you move Ray with mose/trackpad in current Zen, it moves up, down, left and right corresponding to the movement of the device.

We are planning to add a new mode, in which the user end of Ray is fixed to a point. Zwin protocol will allow the apps to chose one of these modes when interacting with Ray. That makes it easier to do some operations such as rotation on the 3D apps.

#### Change in the number of boards
In Zen, now users can only change the number of boards with the configuration file and it cannot be increased/decreased at runtime.

After the second release, the users will be able to change the number of boards intereactively at runtime. It enables the users to customize their VR desktop environment more freely.
